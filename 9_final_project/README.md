# Final Project - Personal Finance Calculator

The goal of this project is to create an easy and simple personal finance calculator. The point is twofold;

1. To provide a quick tool that people can use as a guide to help them consciously manage their finances.
2. To demonstrate the use of Python. (At this point in my career I am working on functional testing in Python full-time).

## Table of Contents

The calculator is split into 6 stages:

- [ ] [Budget and reduce expenses, set realistic goals](#budget-and-reduce-expenses-set-realistic-goals)
- [ ] [Build an emergency fund](#build-an-emergency-fund)
- [ ] [Employer-sponsored matching funds](#employer-sponsored-matching-funds)
- [ ] [Pay down high interest debts](#pay-down-high-interest-debts)
- [ ] [Contribute to an IRA](#contribute-to-an-ira)
- [ ] [Save more for retirement](#save-more-for-retirement)
- [ ] [Save for other goals](#save-for-other-goals)
