# Personal Finance Calculator

#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>

#### Description:

The goal of this project is to create an easy and simple personal finance calculator. The point is twofold;

1. To provide a quick tool that people can use as a guide to help them consciously manage their finances.
2. To demonstrate a basic mastering of the use of Python programming language.

The calculator is split into 6 stages:

- [ ] [Budget and reduce expenses, set realistic goals](#budget-and-reduce-expenses-set-realistic-goals)
- [ ] [Build an emergency fund](#build-an-emergency-fund)
- [ ] [Employer-sponsored matching funds](#employer-sponsored-matching-funds)
- [ ] [Pay down high interest debts](#pay-down-high-interest-debts)
- [ ] [Contribute to an IRA](#contribute-to-an-ira)
- [ ] [Save more for retirement](#save-more-for-retirement)

## Project Status

In Progress

## Definition of Done

The final project is considered complete when all of the following criteria are met:

1. The project is implemented in Python.
2. The project has a main function and at least three additional functions.
3. At least three additional functions are accompanied by tests that can be executed with pytest.
4. The main function is in a file called `project.py`, located in the root directory of the project.
5. The three required custom functions are also in `project.py` and defined at the same indentation level as the main function.
6. The test functions are in a file called `test_project.py`, also in the root directory of the project. They have the same name as the custom functions, prepended with `test_`.
7. The project requires more time and effort to implement than each of the courseâ€™s problem sets.
8. Any pip-installable libraries that the project requires are listed, one per line, in a file called `requirements.txt` in the root of the project.

Once all these criteria are met, the project can be considered done.
